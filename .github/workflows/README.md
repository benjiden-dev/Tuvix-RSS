# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains CI/CD workflows for the TuvixRSS project.

## Workflow Overview

### Branch Flow
```
feature branch → development branch → main branch
```

### Workflows

#### 1. CI - Feature Branch (`ci-feature.yml`)
**Triggers:** Pull requests targeting the `development` branch

**Jobs:**
- Lint & Format Check
- Type Check
- Test API
- Test App
- Build

**Purpose:** Validate code quality and ensure builds succeed before merging to development.

#### 2. CI - Development Branch (`ci-development.yml`)
**Triggers:** Pull requests targeting the `main` branch

**Jobs:**
- Lint & Format Check
- Type Check
- Test API (with coverage upload)
- Test App (with coverage upload)
- Build (with artifact upload)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation before merging to main, including test coverage tracking.

#### 3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers (`deploy-cloudflare.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Published releases
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs:**
- Deploy API to Cloudflare Workers
- Deploy App to Cloudflare Pages
- Run database migrations
- Notify deployment status

**Purpose:** Automated deployment to production on releases.

## Required Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

### Cloudflare Secrets
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Cloudflare API token with Workers and Pages permissions
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID
- `D1_DATABASE_ID` - Your D1 database ID (from `wrangler d1 create tuvix`)
- `CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_NAME` - Name of your Cloudflare Worker (e.g., `tuvix-api`)
- `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_PROJECT_NAME` - Name of your Cloudflare Pages project
- `VITE_API_URL` - API URL for the frontend build (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com/trpc`)

### How to Get Cloudflare Credentials

1. **API Token:**
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens
   - Create token with permissions: `Account.Cloudflare Workers:Edit`, `Account.Cloudflare Pages:Edit`
   - Copy the token

2. **Account ID:**
   - Found in Cloudflare Dashboard → Right sidebar under "Account ID"

3. **D1 Database ID:**
   - Run `npx wrangler d1 create tuvix` locally
   - Copy the `database_id` from the output
   - Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click the **"Secrets"** tab (not "Variables" - we use Secrets for sensitive data)
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `D1_DATABASE_ID` (must match exactly - this is used by the workflow)
   - Value: Paste your database ID
   - Click "Add secret"
   - The workflow reads this secret (via `${{ secrets.D1_DATABASE_ID }}`) and sets it as an environment variable for the deployment step

4. **Worker Name:**
   - Check `packages/api/wrangler.toml` → `name` field

5. **Pages Project Name:**
   - Create a Pages project in Cloudflare Dashboard or use existing name

## Usage

### Feature Branch Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `development`
2. Make changes and push
3. Create a PR targeting `development`
4. CI runs automatically on PR open/update

### Development Branch Workflow
1. Merge feature branch to `development`
2. Create a PR from `development` to `main`
3. CI runs automatically with coverage tracking
4. Once merged, code is on `main` and ready for release

### Deployment Workflow

#### Automatic (on Release)
1. Create a new release in GitHub (tagged version, e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. Workflow automatically deploys to Cloudflare

#### Manual
1. Go to Actions → Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
4. Click "Run workflow"

## Workflow Features

- **Parallel Jobs:** All CI jobs run in parallel for faster feedback
- **Concurrency Control:** Duplicate workflow runs are cancelled automatically
- **Caching:** pnpm and Node.js dependencies are cached
- **Artifacts:** Build artifacts and coverage reports are uploaded
- **Coverage Reporting:** Coverage is uploaded to GitHub and displayed in PRs
- **Environment Protection:** Production deployment uses GitHub environments
- **Database Migrations:** Automatically runs D1 migrations after successful deployment
- **Status Notifications:** Deployment summary in GitHub Actions
- **Release Tag Checkout:** Deployment workflow checks out the specific release tag

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails on Lint/Format
- Run `pnpm run lint:fix` and `pnpm run format:fix` locally
- Commit and push fixes

### Deployment Fails
- Check Cloudflare API token permissions
- Verify account ID is correct
- Ensure Worker and Pages projects exist
- Check Cloudflare dashboard for error details

### Tests Fail
- Run tests locally: `pnpm run test`
- Check test output for specific failures
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Coverage Not Showing
- Coverage is generated automatically during test runs
- Check that `coverage/lcov.info` files exist in package directories
- Coverage reports appear in PR comments automatically
- View detailed coverage reports in the Actions artifacts

## Customization

### Adding New Checks
Edit the appropriate workflow file and add a new job:

```yaml
new-check:
  name: New Check
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v6
    # ... your steps
```

### Changing Node/pnpm Versions
Update the `env` section in workflow files or individual job steps.

### Extending Deployment
Add additional deployment targets or steps in `deploy-cloudflare.yml`.

## Branch Protection Setup

To ensure CI checks are enforced, configure branch protection rules:

### For `development` branch:
1. Go to Settings → Branches → Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `development`
3. Enable:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
4. Required status checks:
   - `lint-and-format`
   - `type-check`
   - `test-api`
   - `test-app`
   - `build`

### For `main` branch:
1. Go to Settings → Branches → Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Require review from code owners (optional)
4. Required status checks:
   - `lint-and-format`
   - `type-check`
   - `test-api`
   - `test-app`
   - `build`

## Dependabot

Dependabot is configured to:
- Check for updates monthly
- Group production and development dependencies separately
- Create PRs with appropriate labels
- Use conventional commit messages

PRs created by Dependabot will automatically trigger CI workflows.

## Coverage Reporting

Coverage is automatically generated and reported in several ways:

### In Pull Requests
- Coverage comments are automatically posted to PRs showing:
  - Overall coverage percentage
  - Coverage changes (increase/decrease)
  - Coverage by package (API vs App)
- Coverage diff shows what changed in the PR

### Coverage Artifacts
- Full HTML coverage reports are uploaded as artifacts
- Download from Actions → Workflow run → Artifacts
- View detailed line-by-line coverage in your browser

### Coverage Files
Coverage is generated in multiple formats:
- `lcov.info` - Used for GitHub integration
- `coverage-final.json` - JSON format for merging
- `index.html` - HTML report (in artifacts)

### Viewing Coverage Locally
```bash
# Generate coverage for both packages
pnpm run test:coverage

# View merged coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

### Coverage Thresholds
- **App:** 60% minimum (lines, branches, functions, statements)
- **API:** Currently no thresholds (aspirational - will increase over time)

Coverage reporting uses Codecov's GitHub Action, which works automatically for public repositories. For private repositories, you may need to add a `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret.
