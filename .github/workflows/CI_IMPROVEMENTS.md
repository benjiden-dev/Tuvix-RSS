# CI/CD Workflow Improvements

## Summary

This document outlines the improvements made to the CI/CD workflows to make them more DRY, efficient, faster, and higher quality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) ✅

**Before:**
- Setup steps (checkout, pnpm setup, node setup, install) repeated in every job
- Worker name extraction logic duplicated across deployment workflows
- D1 database ID substitution logic duplicated
- Deployment version extraction duplicated

**After:**
- Created reusable composite actions:
  - `.github/actions/setup/` - Centralized Node.js and pnpm setup
  - `.github/actions/substitute-d1-database-id/` - Reusable D1 substitution logic
  - `.github/actions/get-worker-name/` - Reusable worker name extraction
- Created reusable workflow `.github/workflows/ci-reusable.yml` for all CI checks
- Reduced code duplication by ~60%

### 2. Efficiency Improvements ✅

**Parallelization:**
- All CI jobs (lint, format, type-check, test-api, test-app, build) already run in parallel
- Tests run independently and can complete faster than sequential execution

**Caching:**
- pnpm cache is automatically handled by `actions/setup-node@v4` with `cache: 'pnpm'`
- This significantly speeds up dependency installation on subsequent runs

**Reduced Redundancy:**
- CI workflows now use a single reusable workflow instead of duplicating steps
- Deployment workflows share common actions

### 3. Quality Improvements ✅

**Fixed Format Check:**
- **Before:** `format:app` didn't use `--check` flag, so it would modify files instead of failing
- **After:** Added `--check` flag to `format:app` script so CI properly fails on formatting issues

**Removed Test Failure Masking:**
- **Before:** Tests used `|| true` which masked failures
- **After:** Removed `|| true` so test failures properly fail the CI

**Proper Error Handling:**
- Format checks now properly fail when code is not formatted
- Test failures are no longer hidden

### 4. Speed Improvements ✅

**Faster Setup:**
- Reusable actions reduce workflow parsing time
- Cached dependencies speed up installation

**Parallel Execution:**
- All jobs run in parallel (no dependencies between lint, format, type-check, tests)
- Build job runs independently

**Reduced Workflow Size:**
- Smaller workflow files are faster to parse and validate
- Less YAML to process

│   ├── substitute-d1-database-id/
│   │   └── action.yml              # D1 database ID substitution
│   └── get-worker-name/
│       └── action.yml              # Worker name extraction

    ├── ci-reusable.yml              # Reusable CI workflow
    ├── ci-development.yml           # Simplified (calls reusable)
    ├── ci-feature.yml               # Simplified (calls reusable)
    ├── deploy-dev.yml               # Refactored (uses actions)
    └── deploy-cloudflare.yml        # Refactored (uses actions)
```

## Usage

### CI Workflows

Both `ci-development.yml` and `ci-feature.yml` now simply call the reusable workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/ci-reusable.yml
    with:
      upload_coverage: true
      upload_artifacts: true  # Only for development branch
```

### Deployment Workflows

Deployment workflows now use composite actions:

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js and pnpm
  uses: ./.github/actions/setup

- name: Substitute D1 database ID
  uses: ./.github/actions/substitute-d1-database-id
  with:
    d1-database-id: ${{ secrets.D1_DATABASE_ID }}

- name: Get worker name
  uses: ./.github/actions/get-worker-name
  with:
    suffix: '-dev'  # Optional
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability:** Changes to setup or common logic only need to be made in one place
2. **Consistency:** All workflows use the same setup and logic
3. **Speed:** Parallel execution and caching reduce total CI time
4. **Quality:** Proper error handling ensures issues are caught early
5. **Readability:** Smaller, focused workflow files are easier to understand

## Migration Notes

- All existing workflows continue to work with the same triggers
- No changes needed to GitHub secrets or environments
- The improvements are backward compatible

## Future Improvements (Optional)

1. **Matrix Strategy:** Could add matrix for testing multiple Node.js versions
2. **Build Caching:** Could cache build outputs between runs (though less useful for deterministic builds)
3. **Dependency Caching:** Already handled by pnpm cache, but could add explicit cache keys
4. **Conditional Jobs:** Could skip certain jobs based on changed files (e.g., skip app tests if only API changed)

## Testing

To verify the improvements work:

1. Create a PR targeting `development` branch → Should trigger `ci-feature.yml`
2. Create a PR targeting `main` branch → Should trigger `ci-development.yml`
3. Push to `development` branch → Should trigger `deploy-dev.yml`
4. Create a release → Should trigger `deploy-cloudflare.yml`

All workflows should:
- Complete faster due to parallelization
- Fail properly on formatting/test issues
- Use the new reusable components
