# Tuvix

**Take back your feed.**

Tuvix is a modern RSS aggregator that helps you follow all your favorite blogs, podcasts, and news sources in one place. It's not a social network, it's not an algorithmic feed, it's just old-fashioned RSS.

## Hosted

Head over to **[tuvix.app](https://tuvix.app)** to create your free account and start reading!

Immediately begin subscribing to your favorite feeds. Remember, you can always export your data to OPML and migrate to your own self-hosted instance, or any other RSS reader.
