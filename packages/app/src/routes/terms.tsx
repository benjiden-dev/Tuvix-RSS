              TuvixRSS may offer different subscription tiers with varying

            </p>

            <h2>RSS Feed Fetching</h2>
            <p>
              When you subscribe to RSS feeds, TuvixRSS fetches content from
              those sources on your behalf. You acknowledge that:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to access
                and aggregate those feeds
              </li>
              <li>
                Some feeds may have usage restrictions or require attribution
              </li>
              <li>
                TuvixRSS is not responsible for the content or availability of
                third-party RSS feeds
              </li>

            <h2>Public Feeds</h2>
            <p>
              You can create public feeds that combine multiple RSS sources.
              When creating public feeds:
            </p>

                You are responsible for the content you include in public feeds
              </li>
              <li>
                Do not create public feeds from sources that prohibit
                redistribution
              </li>
              <li>
                We may remove public feeds that violate these terms or
                third-party rights

            </ul>

            <h2>Telemetry and Error Reporting</h2>
            <p>
              Our hosted version uses <strong>Sentry</strong> for error tracking
              and performance monitoring to improve the application. This
              telemetry:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Is <strong>optional</strong> and <strong>off by default</strong>{" "}
                in self-hosted installations
              </li>
              <li>
                Collects error logs, performance metrics, and usage patterns
              </li>
              <li>May include anonymous session data</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            <p>
              For guaranteed uptime, consider self-hosting TuvixRSS on your own
